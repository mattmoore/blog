# The Problem of Evil and The Free Will Theodicy

Here’s a good crash course video on the problem of evil:

Essentially, a theodicy is an "answer to the question of why God permits evil". John Green discusses the theodicies that are often given.

The free will theodicy is fundamentally flawed. Catholicism makes the claim that God is omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient. This would mean that nothing He creates could possibly be imperfect, or it would imply that God is imperfect.

If we think of all of creation as the product of a designer, then we can define evil as malfunction. Evil exists when the designer's creation misbehaves and does not fulfill his original purpose for it. Now, human creations are flawed. They wear out over time, they malfunction, sometimes even dangerously—but there’s no question that humans are imperfect; we make mistakes. But what would we expect from a perfect designer? We would expect to see a creation that cannot wear out, that is incapable of malfunctioning, that fulfills its intended purpose.

In a classic Catholic sense where an individual is able to choose to malfunction—thereby exercising free will—God must not be powerful enough or lacks the foresight to prevent creating a mind that will choose evil (or malfunction). Essentially He is incompetent, or he is competent but unwilling, and is therefore not all good.

Catholicism argues that the devil was the first sinner, that Adam and Eve were the first human sinners, that original sin is where sin came from. But the very fact that the first sinners were capable of malfunctioning means that they were imperfect for they did not fulfill their intended purpose. Thus we are left concluding that either God is incompetent or He does not care enough to make perfect creatures.

Any attempts to try to justify a God who is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient in light of the evil-stricken reality in which we exist are inherently flawed because they miss this fundamental point: that a God having these attributes, by definition, cannot create anything but a perfect reality with perfect beings who remain perfect. A God like that and a reality like ours creates a paradox.
