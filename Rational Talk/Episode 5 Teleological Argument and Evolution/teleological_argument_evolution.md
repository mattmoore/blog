# The Teleological Argument's Nemesis: Evolution

Evolution is one of those topics that seems to strike a nerve with many contemporary believers. There seems to be an implicit fear that if evolution is proven true, then atheists must be right about there being no gods. There is much confusion in religious communities in the United States, including Catholic and Islamic groups, about what evolution is. In many cases, believers attacking evolution have no clue what it is, which often results in them making silly references to monkeys.

Let's get something straight up front: One can hold evolution to be true and still be a believer. Evolution does nothing to disprove the existence of deities. Evolution does not establish how life got started&mdash;that would be the study of *abiogenesis*, which means "life from non-life". Evolution deals with how species developed from that first common ancestor over millions of years, including our species, *Homo sapiens*. That being said, the facts of evolution disprove intelligent design so solidly that it can be thrown into the same rubbish bin as beliefs in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.

Disclaimer: I am not an expert in the field of evolution. I will discuss the higher-level concepts, as well as some of the observations made. I would encourage the audience to study the matter in greater detail. I will provide some resources at the end of this episode for those interested in further discovery.

## A Theory by any Other Name...

One of the confusions among anti-evolutionists is with the word theory. Often they will say evolution is *just* a theory. In this context, anti-evolutionists are using the word "theory" in a colloquial sense. In a scientific context, theory doesn't mean the same thing. A scientific theory explains how an observed fact works. There is a theory of gravity. There is also a theory of electromagnetism, which we use for manipulating electric current for use in our electronics. The explanations given by these theories are true because they have been demonstrated repeatably and reliably by many observers. Our smart phones are one such piece of evidence that our theory about electromagnetism happens to be true. Einstein's theory about gravitation, known as the Theory of General Relativity, is demonstrated through many directly observable things such as detectable time dilation present in earth orbiting satellites, which we have to compensate for in order for GPS to function in our smartphones, and to keep satellites from being lost. Perhaps the simplest demonstration of gravity is Sir Isaac Newton's apple experience: apples fall from tree to earth. Not "upward", but "downward".

So there are observations we make. These are called facts. The apple falls from the tree. Electricity powers my smartphone. Then there is the question: *Why* does the apple fall from the tree? *Why* does electricity power my smartphone? What is the underlying explanation for these observed facts? The answer to the *why* the fact occurs is called a *theory*. I cannot stress enough the importance of a proper definition of scientific theory, and the delineation between *facts* and *theories*. When we make observations about things (facts) we then try to explain why they occur (theories). We test the correctness of our theory&mdash;or explanation of why&mdash;by observing whether predictions made by it occur. If you're still not sure, or your false notion of scientific theory is still in your head, go read [Evolution is Not Just a Theory](http://www.notjustatheory.com/) to properly understand what scientists mean when they use the term. Seriously, if you learn nothing else in this episode, you should understand what is meant by the phrase "scientific theory".

The theory of evolution, like that of gravity and electromagnetism, is an explanation of *why* biological facts, such as how the variety of species today have come to exist, and why some species are extant while others have gone extinct. There are facts, such as the fossil record in geology, which contains many examples of speciation events dating back millions of years. There is also the fact of genetics, from which we can positively identify evolutionary indicators, demonstrating common ancestry between us and other species. There are not only observed facts about evolution that has already taken place without human intervention, there are also experiments and tasks we have carried out where we have made use of the fact of evolution to genetically modify, and in some cases create, entirely new species.

In this section I will link to several videos describing, in simple layman's terms, what the theory of evolution entails.

## What is Evolution?

First watch this video. It gives a good cursory explanation of the theory of evolution.

## What is Natural Selection?

Next, watch this video which describes the process of natural selection, and how it plays a role in evolution.

## What is the Evidence for Evolution?

In this video let's discover some of the evidences from which we can tell evolution has occurred.

From the above videos it should be clear that evolution is a term that encompasses two key elements: genetics and natural selection. Mankind did not turn from a monkey into a human. Over many generations, gene changes occurred within the genome of our early ancestors. Over time, more gene mutations occurred, building up across successive generations. Eventually enough genetic changes occur that, far enough in the future, descendants look and behave quite differently from their common ancestors. At some point, there is enough genetic difference that if we were to build a time machine and pair the ancestor with its distant descendant, they could no longer mate. At this point they are no longer the same species. The point at which a descendant can no longer mate with an ancestor is called speciation.

For more information about evolution, including further lines of evidence, I encourage you to visit the University of Berkeley's evolution site: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/. In particular, visit their resource library: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/resourcelibrary.php

## Why Is Evolution So Significant?

The science of evolution demonstrates that the many species of life on this planet, including *homo sapiens*, are the result of two natural processes: genetic mutation and natural selection. There is no evidence that *homo sapiens* was designed by God as we exist today. We are the result of millions of years of evolutionary changes occurring over many generations. Does this mean there is no God? As I mentioned before, no. But evolution does provide us with the evidence necessary to remove the supernatural "magic" from how our species got here, just as our knowledge of electromagnetism demonstrates to us that lightning isn't the result of Zeus casting thunderbolts at us, and how we build our smartphones.
