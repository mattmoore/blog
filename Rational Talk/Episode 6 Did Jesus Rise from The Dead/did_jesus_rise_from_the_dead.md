# Did Jesus Rise from The Dead?

The resurrection of Jesus is viewed by many to be the single most important event in Christianity. If it didn't happen, it's a big problem for Christians. There is a debate that happened recently between [Matt Dillahunty](http://www.atheist-experience.com/people/matt_dillahunty/), who is a host on the [Atheist Experience](http://www.atheist-experience.com/) and the [Atheist Debates](https://www.patreon.com/AtheistDebates), and [Blake Giunta](https://beliefmap.org/about-us/blake-giunta/) about whether Jesus actually rose from the dead. I would recommend it especially for believers in Jesus' alleged resurrection.
