# Violence: The Ultimate Danger of Religious Doctrine

Up to this point, I've been considering whether the claims for religion are true. While I intend to continue investigating religious claims, I have decided in this episode to discuss religiously-motivated violence, the unfortunate result of Abrahamic faiths.

## Dogma: The Ultimate Evil

Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) are based on a central notion: dogma. Religion requires the complete and utter acceptance of proclamations about reality that, until the last few hundred years or so, brought much violence and oppression. Now, often Christians will talk disdainfully about Islam and criticize it as being a violent religion. I would agree on this point. For the record, I make a distinction between Islam&mdash;a set of beliefs and doctrines&mdash;and Muslims&mdash;people who believe at least some portion of the tenants and doctrines of Islam. There are peaceful Muslims, just as there are peaceful Christians.

The problem with dogma is that it requires adherence whether it's demonstrably true or not. If you're able to demonstrate that a particular doctrine is factually incorrect, you then become a heretic (worthy of hell) simply because you dare to question the authority of some holy book or holy man. Many of the Christian doctrines are simply factually false and impossible. Virgins giving birth and pieces of bread turning into a the dead body of an ancient Jew for starters, not to mention the magical talking donkeys and snakes. Yet if you deny any of these things, you are labeled a heretic and allegedly some mythical man in the sky will sentence you to an eternity of torment. That's right, God gave you a brain, but shame on you if you try to use it!

It seems that a lot of Christians have forgotten just how violent their own religion is. In my discussions with Christians, I find them outright denying the violent passages and abysmal morals prescribed in their scriptures and by their faith. Ironically, when I confront some Christians with the violent passages in their own holy book, they respond in an almost violent manner. I thought it would be a good idea to list some of these passages here, and discuss some of the arguments provided by Christians to justify these passages. Don't take my word for it. I encourage you to click on each link in the list below and read the passages. Note that the list below is by no means a comprehensive one; these are some of the more vile and grotesque ones that I happened to quickly jot down.

## Morally Reprehensible Verses

### Murder, Genocide, & Cannibalism

-   [Genesis 22:2](http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm) - God commands Abraham to sacrifice his own son to God. God allegedly stops Abraham at the last minute, but what kind of sick and twisted personality would play such games? Apparently God and Abraham.

-   [Jeremiah 19:9](http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-9.htm) - God says he will have Judah and Jerusalem eat the flesh of their sons and daughters. Yeah, you heard that right, cannibalism.

-   [Numbers 31](http://www.drbo.org/chapter/04031.htm) - God commands Moses to commit genocide of the Madianites. This is morally reprehensible and has been considered a war crime throughout modern history. As if that wasn't bad enough, God has Moses take the young Madianite girls as slaves and disburse them among the Jewish army as sex slaves and raped. Note that these girls in many cases were young teens, probably about 12 years of age or so. Under the old Jewish covenant, it was commonplace to own concubines (sex slaves) who were barely pubescent. It was also commonplace to own many wives (wives were considered the legal property of their husbands). A wife had no legal standing to prosecute her husband for rape. If a husband wanted sex with a concubine or one of his wives, she was legally obligated to provide her body to him, whether she wanted to or not. Incidentally, *these same laws are shared in Sharia today*. While I have a later section on misogynistic passages, this one clearly is misogynistic, but I listed it here because, while I think misogyny is a terrible thing, I think genocide of an entire civilization is even worse.

-   [1 Samuel 15:3](http://www.drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&bk=9&ch=15&l=3#x) - God commands Saul to slaughter Amalec and destroy everything Amalec has, including his possessions, his wives and children, his servants, and his animals.

-   [1 Samuel 22:18](http://www.drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=22&l=18#x) - Witches and wizards are to be murdered.

-   [1 Samuel 22:19](http://www.drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=22&l=19#x) - If you have sex with an animal, you are to be murdered. Granted, I find that to be a fairly disgusting act, but one worth murdering someone over?

-   [1 Samuel 22:20](http://www.drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=22&l=20#x) - If you sacrifice to any gods besides the Jewish one, you are to be murdered.

-   [Psalm 137:9](http://biblehub.com/psalms/137-9.htm) - Praises dashing babies against rocks. Ironic, given that Christians who want to take away a woman's right to choose don't seem to have a problem with this.

### Slavery

-   [Leviticus 25:44-46](http://biblehub.com/niv/leviticus/25.htm) - Instructions about the purchase of slaves are given. Apparently God is A-OK with slavery.

-   [1 Peter 2:18](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm) - Peter endorses slavery and commands slaves to be obedient and respectful of their masters, even if their masters are evil.

### Misogyny

-   [2 Timothy 12](http://www.drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&bk=61&ch=2&l=12#x) - Paul forbids women from teaching or having authority over a man, and to be silent.

-   [Ephesians 5:22](http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm) - Paul commands that women should be subservient to their husbands as though he were God Himself, rather than equal partners in a relationship. I'm starting to see a pattern here. Paul sure seems to hate women.

## Common Christian Defenses

It's rather ironic that, if Christians are right about everything, they need to defend themselves. Indeed, the word "apologetics" means "systematic argumentative discourse in defense (as of a doctrine)" ([Merriam-Webster dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apologetics)). Why does the truth need a defense? Doesn't truth stand on its own? In any case, many Christians argue that passages like the ones above are being taken out of context. The problem with this argument is that it requires one to accept that morals are not objective, and do not apply in all circumstances. This is moral relativism, leading to a state of cognitive dissonance, since many Christians also reject moral relativism. Often, they accuse atheists of moral relativism. For the record, I do not accept moral relativism. If God is always perfect, then He cannot change, as that would mean He is not perfect. If God is unable to change, due to His existing perfection, then what He establishes as morally acceptable for one time must also be morally acceptable at any other time. If murder, slavery, and rape are immoral today, they must also be immoral thousands of years ago when, allegedly, the events cited above happened. While the passages cited above are mostly ones wherein God commanded evil acts, some Christians will argue that some passages are simply recording what happened, not what God directly commanded. But imagine I were the ruler of some country. If I didn't punish those who commit murder and genocide, wouldn't I be contributing to it? Does Edmund Burke's phrase "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" mean anything?

I do not accept that murder and genocide are moral under any context. I do not accept that rape and slavery are OK. I do not accept these things as moral now nor thousands of years ago. If you hold that these could be moral under some time frame or cultural context, you are but a disgusting and vile thug that I have no interest in having a discussion with. You, sir or madam, are the problem with human society and you should be ashamed of yourself.
