# Introduction

I was once Roman Catholic.

Now I am a skeptic. I am naturalist. I am an atheist. I am a secular humanist. I think David Hume generally got it more right than any of the Christian philosophers. I am a firm believer in the scientific method and empiricism, because I like to hold the kind of beliefs that can be verified and tested. I choose empiricism as my arbiter of truth because science has demonstrated that it works. It yields objective, working theories that encourage skeptical attacks. Scientifically acquired knowledge hones itself in the fires of trial and challenge&mdash;unlike religion, which demands naive obedience to the whims of its leaders, and an assumed deity who punishes thought crimes and cares whether we eat shrimp or steak&mdash;depending on the time of day.

I still have religious friends. I still like them. Obviously there are disagreements between us on the present topic. You can imagine the repercussions following the discovery that I no longer believed as they do. They argued and pleaded on God's behalf. They tried to convince me to save my soul. As these attempts continued, I began to realize that we were having circular arguments. I would state my position and then in some later conversation my position, with all its nuances, would be forgotten.

I began to write a book. I hoped that if I could just write down the majority of my thoughts on the matter in a single cohesive form, that my friends could read this book and better understand my position. Perhaps someone else out there could benefit from it. I am not a celebrity. I am simply someone whose background might be similar enough to another fellow human out there that it might be helpful to know that they're not alone. I am also not the first person to do this. Many ex-Christians have written about the topic. However, I have found the literature from an ex-Catholic perspective to be somewhat lacking.

Unfortunately, writing a full book is a challenging endeavor, and can easily be a full-time task. Time was flying fast and I seemed to find less and less time to write the book as comprehensively as I wanted to. I was quickly coming to the conclusion that I needed a faster method of discussing the arguments. To this end I decided to break up the topics in the book I had been working on, and publish shorter sections online.

To that end, I am beginning here, on my blog. I hope to publish more articles in time. Perhaps I will compile these back into my book at some point, but for the moment I will make use of this method. My goal is to publish on a timeframe of every week or at least every other week. Hopefully I can make that goal.

I like to listen to podcasts because it is something I can do while going about other tasks. If that is the case for any readers, I am hoping to also have an audio version available. It may take more time to get the audio versions published.
