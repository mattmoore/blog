# Trump

It's November, 2016. Donald Trump has won the United States Presidency. At least, he won the electoral college. He lost the popular vote by a landslide. But in the U.S. the electoral college is all that matters. In a country that touts freedom and democracy, the people's will be damned.

I've tried to steer clear of the political arguments and debates. I've tried to keep my relationships with family and friends on positive terms. And yet, the election keeps coming up. You might think I'm speaking of the time before the election. Nope. I'm speaking about before and *after* the election. That's right, even though Trump has won and there's a congress in place that will do his bidding, there are people still trying to convince me that he is the right choice.

Why? Trump won. For his supporters, isn't that what matters? I cannot fathom why there are still people trying to convince me. It's almost as though those who supported him need others to confirm that they did the right thing. They won't be happy until society affirms their choice.

Who did I vote for? Hillary Clinton. For the record, I think she's a terrible person. Who did I want? Bernie Sanders&mdash;I voted for him in the primaries. What do I think of Trump? The worst thing that could have happened for everyone. I think Hillary is the worst person to have as President of the United States, *except* for Donald Trump.

And yet, that's not enough for Trump supporters. They still want an affirmation of their choice. They still want those who wouldn't support Trump to say to them: "You know, you're right, Trump is the better choice. What was I thinking?!"

Look, Hillary is corrupt. Perhaps one of the most corrupt politicians in recent American history. I look at her with disdain because she could have been the first woman to become President, and she utterly failed. Why? Lots of people like to blame external factors like FBI director James Comey. Should he have opened another investigation into Hillary's emails a second time just to say, nevermind? Perhaps not. But why is Hillary in this position to begin with? She's obviously hiding something. I get completely get it.

But let's be honest. Trump is just as corrupt. Depending on how you count it, he's even more corrupt than Hillary. This is a man who refuses to pay the contractors who built his empire, buys his way out of trouble, degrades women, jokes about raping women, makes unacceptable racial slurs against non-whites. Trump is a man who thrives on destroying people.

Trump supporters keep citing that he's a business man, that he's wealthy, that he's not one of the corrupt politicians. Well, let's examine these claims:

*   Trump is a business man: First off, Trump is not a self-made business man, nor a very successful one. His money came from his father, and has had six business ventures go bankrupt. Regardless, what does being a business man have to do with the Presidency? I'm actually not convinced that being a business man is in any way a qualifier for the Presidency. There are far more important qualities than being a business man.
*   Trump is pro-life: No he's not! Not once in his life has he said he is pro-life. The most he's done is say that the issue that Roe vs. Wade settled should be determined at the state level, and that he would appoint justices who are conservative. That's not a pro-life stance at all. [Read this article here](http://thefederalist.com/2016/10/20/trump-presidency-hurt-pro-life-more-than-hillary/).
