# Thomas Aquinas: "The Five Ways"

Thomas Aquinas developed five arguments in his Summa Theologica to "prove" the existence of God. The Catholic Church uses these arguments formally as reasons to believe in a god. Others have reworded these in different ways, but Aquinas' arguments are considered by many to be the original arguments presented by Christianity, so this seems as good a place to start as any.

While Aquinas presents five separate arguments, they ultimately collapse into three main categories: the cosmological&mdash;or causal&mdash;arguments, the argument of gradation, and the argument from design, also known as the teleological argument. I will list the original five arguments in brief, and then respond to the respective categories.

## Parts I, II, III: Cosmological Arguments (Causality)

*   Part I: The Argument from Motion: Aquinas argues that since things move, there must be an unmoved mover.
*   Part II: The Argument from Efficient Cause: The sequence of causes which make up this universe must have a first cause.
*   Part III: The Argument to Necessary Being: Since all existent things depend upon other things for their existence, there must be at least one thing that is not dependent upon other things and is therefore a necessary being.

These first three arguments are arguments about causality. We have observed causality in nature, that is, that one thing causes another. Everything appears to have a beginning. This appears to be true for everything we have observed thus far. The universe must also have had a beginning. But what caused the universe? An intelligent being must have created the universe. Aquinas calls that intelligent being God.

### My Response

From all scientific observations to date, it would appear that the observable universe had a beginning, of sorts. This beginning is called the "big bang". It was a period when matter and energy appear to have sprung into existence, rapidly expanding into the beginnings of the universe we now inhabit.

We have been able to measure backwards in time, using a variety of dating methods, to find out how old the universe is and how rapidly the inflation occurred. What we do not know with certainty is what mechanism caused the inflation, or generated the initial conditions for the universe to even occur. At this point in time, we cannot measure further back in time, because time itself began with the big bang. Time is a property of the universe originating with the big bang. It is impossible, therefore, to know with testable certainty what happened prior to the big bang to cause it. In fact, many physicists have commented that the very concept of "before" or "after" or anything causal, which requires time, is a useless way to think about causality, since time didn't exist. Our intuitive sense of "this causes that" in the reality we inhabit is completely useless when trying to understand the origins of the universe because talking about "this causes that" requires time to exist to begin with.

What does all this mean? It means that if one is going to argue the following causal chain:

    Myself -> Parents -> Grandparents -> ... -> Universe -> God

Then one is immediately confronted with what is called the "problem of infinite regress":

    Myself -> Parents -> Grandparents -> ... -> Universe -> God -> ?!

What caused God? Aquinas' answer was that God doesn't need a cause; He is the uncaused cause. But Aquinas doesn't demonstrate this. He is falling into the fallacy of special pleading. Aquinas is saying that everything needs a cause, including the universe, from which he then concludes God as the cause of the universe. But then Aquinas wants us to suddenly stop using that logic and go no further than God. He wants us to presume that the rule of logic&mdash;namely, everything has a cause&mdash;stops simply because he has asked us to stop using it. If we put this into a syllogism:

    [All real things] are [caused]
    [The universe] is a [real thing]
    Therefore, [the universe] is [caused]

However, a syllogism can only be true if the premises are true. If they aren't, then the conclusion is invalid. If we apply the syllogism to other entities of the same class, we would have the following syllogism:

    [All real things] are [caused]
    [God] is a [real thing]
    Therefore, [God] is [caused]

The problem is that Aquinas has failed to account for this last application of the syllogism he started to use. We are left with the following possible outcomes regarding the syllogism:

1.  Not all real things have a cause, so the major premise is false. If we do this, however, it means that Aquinas' argument fails because it requires the major premise to be true. Aquinas is saying God must exist because he is needed to "solve" the infinite regress problem in causality. If not all real things need a cause, then we would be equally justified in saying that the universe has no beginning, or that it caused itself. This is precisely what Aquinas is saying in regards to God. We can observe the universe directly. We cannot observe God directly (or this whole question would have come to an end long ago). It is therefore more logically sane to conclude that the universe, which can be demonstrated as real, has no cause other than itself, rather than concluding that God, Who cannot be observed, has no cause or caused Himself. Instead of this:

        Myself -> Parents -> Grandparents -> ... -> Universe -> God

      we would have this:

        Myself -> Parents -> Grandparents -> ... -> Universe

2.  God is not a real thing, so the minor premise is false. If this is the case, then this story ends here. If God is not real, then He does not exist by definition, and we might as well be talking about unicorns.

Now, a Christian might argue that the manner in which I have constructed my premises is flawed because I am using the wrong categories. God is a supernatural entity, not a natural one. Therefore the rules of causality that we have assumed for the natural do not affect God because He is above nature. Indeed, we could adjust the major premise of our syllogism from:

    [All real things] are [caused]

to:

    [All natural things] are [caused]

We could also say that:

    [Some supernatural things] are [caused] (Angels, for example)

and

    [Some supernatural things] are [uncaused] (according to Thomas, God is uncaused)

In this way, the Christian might argue that God is an uncaused supernatural entity, and therefore is uncaused. But this is circular reasoning. In order for any of the above premises to be admitted to the syllogism, the following must be true:

    [All supernatural things] are [real]

Or, to put it another way, all supernatural things exist.

But we're back where we started. We've created a massive circular argument wherein we argue that God must exist, because real natural things are caused, but God has no cause, because some supernatural things, like God of course, don't need a cause. This is special pleading. The problem is that while the existence of the natural is demonstrable and therefore not in question&mdash;for example, you're real or you wouldn't be reading this now&mdash;the existence of the supernatural isn't demonstrable, and so cannot be assumed to be real. "God exists because I said so". Of course I am then equally justified in saying "Unicorns exist because I said so". Aquinas is invoking God because he's saying all things need a beginning. Yet he doesn't apply the same logic to God. He also doesn't demonstrate why we can ignore the rules of causality when it comes to God. This argument is self-defeating.

As I mentioned before, the conclusion in a syllogism is only as good as the premises are validated. By validated I mean they are able to be reproduced and observed. If they cannot be reproduced and observed by others, they are indistinguishable from a non-truth, or a lie. We can observe the natural in a consistent, reproducible manner. It is an interesting observation that one never encounters theists arguing for the existence of the planet Earth, because every idiot lives on it. If only the supernatural were testable in this way.

To be clear, I am not arguing that any of this disproves the existence of a god or gods. However, the Christian has no way to disprove the existence of fairies, or leprechauns, or unicorns. The Christian has no way to disprove the existence of Zeus, or Thor, or Aphrodites, or in keeping with contemporary mainstream religions, the existence of Allah. Rational people disregard claims of things that cannot be reproduced and observed. They do not claim to disprove the negative. They simply don't waste time and effort on claims which cannot be validated. There are more false claims than true ones, and one could not possibly evaluate all of them in a single lifetime.

## Part IV: The Argument from Gradation

Aquinas then goes on to argue that because everything has degrees of goodness, there must exist some supreme goodness by which to compare all other things. This is simply ridiculous. I will quote Richard Dawkins in his book, *The God Delusion*:

    That's an argument? You might as well say, people
    vary in smelliness but we can make the comparison
    only by reference to a perfect maximum of
    conceivable smelliness. Therefore there must exist a
    pre-eminently peerless stinker, and we call him God.
    Or substitute any dimension of comparison you like,
    and derive an equivalently fatuous conclusion.

## Part V: The Teleological Argument (The Argument from Design)

Here Aquinas argues that things in the natural world appear to be very complex, appear to be designed, therefore they must have been designed by God. Theists will often say: "Look at the trees! Look at the birds! Everything is so wonderfully complex and designed. God must have created all this!" The problem with this is two-fold:

1.  We now know that non-living things are not designed by an intelligent being, but are the result of naturally-occurring forces which we can observe. Thanks to people like Charles Darwin, we now also know that life is the result of natural processes as well. Evolution has given rise to the many different life forms that exist on this planet today.
2.  Even if we didn't have scientific explanations of the design of the world and the biological entities that exist within it, jumping to the conclusion that an intelligent being created it does not follow. The creationist is assuming a "who" made things the way they are, when the appropriate question is "what" made things the way they are.

We know Aquinas' fifth argument to be outright wrong since the dawn of science. I will not get into evolution until the next episode, as there is a lot of ground to cover on that topic, especially for those who do not fully understand what evolution is.
